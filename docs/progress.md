# Sightlines Rebuild Progress

This is the working implementation checklist for the rebuild. It is intentionally shorter and more tactical than `docs/plan.md`.

Refer to `docs/plan.md` as the full project overview, product/architecture plan, and roadmap source of truth. This file tracks what has already been built and what should be tackled next.

## Done

- [x] Created the new Vite + React + TypeScript application skeleton.
- [x] Added repo-level product context in `PRODUCT.md`.
- [x] Configured Impeccable live mode for the Vite single-shell app.
- [x] Added a local-first `ProjectRepository` interface.
- [x] Implemented an IndexedDB-backed project repository.
- [x] Added versioned project schema validation with Zod.
- [x] Added backwards-compatible defaulting for `wallObjects`.
- [x] Added the initial project data model: `Project`, `Floor`, `RoomPlacement`, `Room`, `RoomVertex`, `Wall`, `Artwork`, and `WallObject`.
- [x] Added the sample single-room project.
- [x] Added wall geometry helpers that derive wall length/angle from vertex IDs.
- [x] Built a first app shell with top bar, wall list, plan view, elevation view, JSON data view, and inspector.
- [x] Added JSON project import/export for early debugging and backup.
- [x] Added local-save status and browser-storage backup messaging.
- [x] Implemented `units/length.ts` for parsing and formatting measurements.
- [x] Added unit tests for measurement parsing/formatting edge cases.
- [x] Implemented pure `resolveSnap()` with snap priority and hysteresis support.
- [x] Added snap tests.
- [x] Added numeric wall-length editing through the inspector.
- [x] Made numeric rectangle edits preserve orthogonal geometry.
- [x] Made rectangle edits use an explicit anchor rule: the selected wall's start vertex stays fixed.
- [x] Made paired walls update together for rectangle rooms because width/height are the real editable dimensions.
- [x] Added geometry edit reporting: changed wall IDs and anchor vertex ID.
- [x] Added placement revalidation plumbing for walls whose lengths changed directly or by cascade.
- [x] Added an inspector warning panel for placement warnings.
- [x] Added browser verification for wall-length edits, orthogonal lock behavior, and basic tab interactions.
- [x] Added tests for geometry edits, schema defaults, and cascaded placement validation.
- [x] Added the rectangle inspector affordance for paired dimensions, so users can see that North/South and East/West are linked.
- [x] Added tests for rectangle paired-wall detection.
- [x] Implemented the first toggleable visual grid overlay for plan and elevation alignment.
- [x] Documented the unified precision-grid model: unit-aware intervals, zoom-adaptive display, continuous floorplan grid behavior, grid snap targets, separate show/snap preferences, and centerline guide behavior.
- [x] Added a toolbar action to reset local browser storage back to a fresh sample project during development.
- [x] Refined plan view framing so room layouts use full-floor bounds with proportional padding.
- [x] Added basic rectangular room creation controls and grouped room/wall navigation in the Gallery panel.
- [x] Introduced the single `applyEdit` pipeline in the store: every mutating action is a thin command constructor; the pipeline stamps `updatedAt`, pushes the undo/redo stack, drops the redo stack, and persists.
- [x] Added project-level undo/redo with toolbar buttons and Cmd/Ctrl+Z / Shift+Cmd+Z / Ctrl+Y shortcuts; document replacement (boot, import, reset) resets the edit history.
- [x] Made the project title commit on blur/Enter (reverting empty input) instead of saving per keystroke.
- [x] Made repository `save()` validate against the current schema before writing, so invalid state can never persist.
- [x] Made repository `list()` read raw summaries and skip unreadable records instead of failing wholesale; `boot` now surfaces a visible load-failure message instead of silently swapping in the sample.
- [x] Added error handling to JSON import — malformed files report "Import failed" and leave the current project untouched.
- [x] Constrained `RoomPlacement.rotationDeg` to 0 in the schema until rotation is actually rendered.
- [x] Added schema invariants: walls form a closed loop in vertex order; wall and placement `roomId`s agree with their containing room.
- [x] Gave `migrateProject` a minimal versioned-shape pre-parse before full validation.
- [x] Injected the project repository into the store via `createAppStore(repository)`, enabling store tests against an in-memory fake.
- [x] Added store tests covering boot, undo/redo round-trips, redo-stack clearing, no-op edit skipping, import failure/success, and load-failure messaging.
- [x] Split `App.tsx` into per-component files (`PlanView`, `ElevationView`, `GridOverlay`, `WallInspector`, `DataView`).
- [x] Centralized the elevation wall-local → SVG y-flip in one `wallLocalYToSvgY` helper.
- [x] Added explicit room Width/Depth dimension controls in the Gallery sidebar for rectangle rooms, alongside the existing per-wall rows — reuses the same paired-wall resize path as the inspector's per-wall Length field via a new generalized `resizeWall(wallId, lengthMm)` store action (`resizeSelectedWall` now delegates to it).
- [x] Made numeric length edits reject non-rectangular rooms instead of silently skewing a neighboring wall's angle. `resizeWallPreservingAngles` previously fell back to moving a single end vertex for any room that wasn't a clean four-wall quad — that fallback could break an adjacent wall's right angle without telling anyone. It now throws a clear, catchable error for that case (`"only supports rectangular rooms"`), and both the wall Length field and the new Width/Depth fields surface it inline instead of producing an unhandled rejection. Skewed/non-90° reshaping stays explicitly reserved for a future dedicated reshape tool, not a numeric-field side effect.
- [x] Replaced the temporary fixed grid interval with the shared precision system from `docs/plan.md` §5.5. Added `domain/units/precision.ts` with unit-aware metric/imperial grid interval tables and `getMinorGridIntervalMm`/`getMajorGridIntervalMm`/`getPixelsPerMm`; added a `useContainerSize` hook so `PlanView`/`ElevationView` measure their actual rendered pixel size via `ResizeObserver` and derive a real pixels-per-mm scale (matching SVG `xMidYMid meet` scaling) instead of assuming one. The grid now genuinely steps to a coarser or finer interval as available screen space changes, with a readable major-line landmark computed from the same table — `getGridSpacingMm` and its fixed constant are gone. Plan and elevation still read separate coordinate spaces, per §5.5.
- [x] Split the single grid toggle into independent "show grid" and "snap to grid" local preferences (`useViewPreferences`), persisted to `localStorage` — never to `Project`/`.sightlines` data, so importing a shared file never imports someone else's working-style preferences. Added a second toolbar toggle (Snap, `Magnet` icon) alongside Grid; `snapToGrid` defaults on and is ready for the next step to consume once grid snap targets exist — it doesn't change rendering yet on its own.
- [x] Added `getGridSnapTargets(intervalMm, visibleBoundsMm)` (`domain/snapping/gridSnapTargets.ts`), generating one lowest-priority `"grid"` `SnapTarget` per visible grid line — vertical lines as `axis: "x"` candidates, horizontal as `axis: "y"` — from the active interval and visible coordinate space, ready to plug straight into `resolveSnap()` alongside centerline/neighbor targets. Capped defensively at 1000 lines/axis independent of caller input. Like `resolveSnap()` itself, this is pure domain plumbing with no call site yet — nothing drags anything on screen until tactile handles exist (still open below), so this is intentionally unwired until then, not a partial feature.
- [x] Added a real new-project / repository list/load/delete flow, replacing the old dev-only "reset local project" button (which nuked every saved project at once — a mismatch between its label and its blast radius now that multiple real projects can exist). Relaxed the schema's `floor.rooms` from `min(1)` to allow an empty floor, since a brand-new project starts with no rooms per the north star (`docs/plan.md` §1.5: room layout and checklist-first are equally valid starting points) — added `createBlankProject(title)` (`domain/newProject.ts`) for this. Added store actions `listProjectSummaries`/`openProject`/`createProject`/`deleteProject` (`deleteProject` falls back to another saved project, or a fresh blank one, if the currently-open project is the one deleted) and a `ProjectPicker` toolbar component listing saved projects with open/delete, sorted by most-recently-updated. Added a minimal empty-state message for the Elevation tab when no wall is selected (previously rendered nothing at all), since a fresh roomless project reaches that state immediately.
- [x] Confirmed (via audit) that "numeric room/wall fields always route through the shared units module" was already true — every user-facing length field (wall length, wall/room height, centerline, room width/depth) already goes through `parseLength`/`formatLength` exclusively; this checklist item was stale, not an open gap.
- [x] Added the first tactile drag handles — two draggable resize handles per rectangle room in Plan view (Width and Depth), the tactile counterpart to the sidebar's numeric Width/Depth fields. Added pure math helpers (`domain/geometry/dragResize.ts`: `projectDeltaOntoAxis`, `computeDraggedLengthMm`) so a 2D pointer drag only affects a wall's length along that wall's own axis. Each handle sits on the wall that actually moves when its dimension changes, not the wall whose length value it edits (resizing wall `i`'s length moves wall `i+1`'s vertices — verified this empirically in the browser for all four walls before locking in the mapping). Drag lifecycle: pointerdown captures the start point via `getScreenCTM()` (client px → SVG mm), live pointermove computes a preview by calling the *same* pure `resizeWallPreservingAngles` used for numeric commits (so dragging and typing can never disagree), and exactly one `resizeWall()` store call fires on release — one undo entry per drag, verified undo/redo round-trips correctly for both handles. A sub-threshold release (click without drag) is a no-op, no phantom undo entry.
- [x] Wired `getGridSnapTargets()`/`resolveSnap()` into the wall-resize drag — their first real call site, and what `snapToGrid` actually gates now. Each pointermove filters grid candidates to the axis the dragged handle can actually move along (a width handle only ever considers vertical grid lines, and vice versa — including the other axis risked spurious snaps from incidental hand-tremor alignment) before calling the same `resolveSnap()` used elsewhere, with hysteresis (`previousSnapTargetId`) carried frame-to-frame in drag state. Added a rendered dashed `.snap-guide` line from `resolveSnap()`'s `activeGuides` while snapped. Verified in the browser: a drag landing within threshold of a grid line snaps to the exact value, both in the live preview and the committed result; with `snapToGrid` off, the same drag commits the raw unsnapped value. (Verifying this surfaced a test-harness gotcha worth remembering: interleaving `preview_eval`/`preview_screenshot` calls *during* an active synthetic drag can inject stray pointer events into the page's real event stream and corrupt the in-progress gesture — mid-drag testing needs one uninterrupted pointerdown→pointermove→pointerup sequence per eval call, not staggered calls with inspection in between.)
- [x] Fixed grid snapping to snap the wall's moving edge, not the raw pointer. The drag previously committed `startLength + (snappedPointer − startPointer)`, so the grab offset within the 16px handle leaked into every committed length — landing on the 15' grid line still produced values like `14' 10 7/8"`. New pure helpers in `domain/geometry/dragResize.ts` (`getMovingWallEdgeWorldPointMm`, `proposeMovingEdgePointMm`, `computeEdgeSnappedLengthMm`) derive the moving edge's world position at drag start and snap *that* to grid targets, so the grab offset cancels exactly and the wall edge lands on the grid line. Regression test proves an off-center grab dragged near the 15' line commits the edge to exactly `feetToMm(15)`; snap-disabled path proven unchanged.
- [x] Added the display-unit toggle — a compact Units select (Imperial: ft, in / Metric: m, cm) in the view toolbar, backed by an undoable, persisted `setUnit` store action through `applyEdit`. Since grid interval tables and all formatting already key off `project.unit`, switching units switches the whole grid family (imperial 1"/2"/3"/6"/1'/… vs metric 5mm/1/2/5/10cm/…) rather than relabeling one spacing, per §5.5.
- [x] Added the user-adjustable grid precision floor from §5.4/§5.5 ("step downward until hitting the user's chosen precision floor"). `getMinorGridIntervalMm` now accepts an optional `minIntervalMm` floor that clamps zoom-adaptive selection up to the smallest table entry ≥ the floor; `getGridPrecisionFloorOptionsMm(unit)` curates the offered floors from each family's own interval table (imperial ½"/1"/6"/1'; metric 5mm/1cm/10cm) so every choice lands on an actual grid step. Persisted as `gridPrecisionFloorMm` (null = auto) in `useViewPreferences` — workspace preference, not project data — with a compact "Precision" select next to Grid/Snap/Units. Because PlanView's snap targets derive from the minor interval, the floor governs snap increments too: one precision system, not three. (Also fixed test infra: Node 25's non-functional built-in `localStorage` global was shadowing jsdom's in Vitest; `src/test/setup.ts` now installs an in-memory Storage when the global is unusable.)
- [x] Hardened JSON import (`docs/plan.md` §2 pipeline): new `migrateProjectJson(text)` in `projectSchema.ts` owns the full size-cap → parse → shape-check → migrate → validate flow. 20 MB import cap checked before `JSON.parse`; distinct calm error messages for not-JSON, not-a-Sightlines-project, made-with-a-newer-schema-version ("open it with a newer version of the app"), Zod validation failure (reformatted path + reason, no raw ZodError dump), non-string, and oversized input. Tests prove the open project is untouched on every failure path and that `exportProjectJson` → `importProjectJson` round-trips deep-equal. Audited prototype-pollution risk: `z.object`'s unknown-key stripping already covers it, no change needed.
- [x] Anchored the elevation grid to the floor per §5.5 ("y=0 should be floor level"): `GridOverlay` gained optional `originXMm`/`originYMm` pattern-phase props (default 0 keeps PlanView's world-origin anchoring), with the phase math in a pure tested `getGridPatternPhaseMm`. ElevationView passes `originYMm={wallHeightMm}` so a horizontal grid line always lands on the floor regardless of wall height. Also extended both interval tables downward (½" imperial, 0.5cm metric) for close-in elevation work — zoom-adaptive selection means these only appear when pixel density allows.

## In Progress / Immediate Next

- [ ] Extend tactile handles to vertex-level dragging for non-rectangular rooms once a reshape mode is designed (today's handles only cover the rectangle width/depth case, matching numeric editing's current scope).

## MVP 1A Remaining

- [ ] Finish the geometry spine from `docs/plan.md` section 9:
  - [ ] Migration function chain (`v1→v2`, ...) when a schema v2 first ships — the parse → validate → migrate → validate pipeline shape already exists in `migrateProject`.
  - [ ] Empty wall elevation view polish (a plain empty-state message now covers the no-wall-selected case; still no dedicated visual treatment).
- [ ] Keep transient drag state out of `applyEdit`/persist when tactile handles arrive — already true for the new wall-resize drag (live preview is computed locally in `PlanView` via the pure `resizeWallPreservingAngles`, never through `applyEdit`, until the single commit on release).
- [ ] Add storage persistence request with `navigator.storage.persist()` where supported.

## MVP 1B Next Major Slice

- [ ] Add global artwork library repository.
- [ ] Add project checklist membership separate from placement.
- [ ] Add image upload/intake.
- [ ] Generate thumbnail/display image tiers.
- [ ] Add artwork metadata editing.
- [ ] Add artwork dimension uncertainty state and shared indicator.
- [ ] Add drag-to-wall placement.
- [ ] Render placed artwork in wall elevation.
- [ ] Run placement changes through pure snapping and validation functions.
- [ ] Add transaction-bounded undo/redo for placement movement.
- [ ] Revalidate placements after any wall geometry change.

## MVP 1C / Later

- [ ] Doors, windows, and blocked zones.
- [ ] Collision validation against obstacles.
- [ ] Multi-select.
- [ ] Grouping and group drag.
- [ ] Equal distribution spacing.
- [ ] Floor objects in plan view.
- [ ] Simple 3D preview.
- [ ] Checklist panel with thumbnail, core fields, and sorting.

## MVP 2 / Later

- [ ] `.sightlines` package export/import.
- [ ] Import safety checks for zip traversal, size caps, MIME validation, and corrupted assets.
- [ ] Library-wide export/import.
- [ ] Prominent save-backup flow.
- [ ] PNG exports.
- [ ] PDF checklist export.
- [ ] Missing/approximate data readiness report.

## Design / UX Notes To Keep

- [ ] Keep `docs/plan.md` as the project overview and roadmap reference.
- [ ] Keep product UI restrained, dense, and task-focused.
- [ ] Avoid making numeric fields imply false independent degrees of freedom.
- [ ] Make constraints visible where they affect behavior.
- [ ] Flag invalid or uncertain state; do not silently fix, hide, clip, or slide user content.
- [ ] Use `sightlines-old/` only as local reference material unless explicitly asked to migrate specific code or assets.
